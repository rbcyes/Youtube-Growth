Over the past few years it is safe to say that online video has literally exploded. The growth of video has led to business worldwide to see the potential of a new video marketing strategy. The best video traffic is experienced from YouTube traffic; there is no doubt about that.
YouTube has experienced massive growth since its inception. An example of the growth can be found in a recent statistic which stated that roughly 48 hours of video content is uploaded to the site every minute. I'm sure you will agree this is nothing short of amazing.
